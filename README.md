# UFOs

### Overview of Project
This project involves updating a previously developed webpage with dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The table filters include city, state, country, and shape. The project challenge involves two primary deliverables:

1.	Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.

2.	Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis.
